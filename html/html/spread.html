<h1>How did COVID-19  spread easily? </h1>
<p> 
Yes, any situation in which people are in close proximity to one another for long periods of time increases the risk of transmission. 
Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations. 
Activities where more particles are expelled from the mouth, such as singing or breathing heavily during exercise, also increase the risk of transmission.
The “Three C’s” are a useful way to think about this.
 They describe settings where transmission of the COVID-19 virus spreads more easily:
Crowded places;
Close-contact settings, especially where people have conversations very near each other;
Confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.  
The risk of COVID-19 spreading is especially high in places where these “3Cs” overlap
